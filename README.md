# DoBA
DoBA (Designed only By AI) is an open source project aiming to project AI development towards more autonomous, percise, neuron-like memory. This code is ran through an API (you can run whatever you want, but this code uses LM Studio). This code is open-source, and aims for any and all contributions to be documented on this repository.
