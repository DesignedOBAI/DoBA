# DoBA (Designed only By AI)

DoBA is an open-source AI system pioneering autonomous, precise, neuron-like memory and advanced emotional intelligence. It features nuclear memory for core fact storage, tokenized fact extraction, and seamless GPU-accelerated document analysis. DoBA is designed to run efficiently with a lightweight setup using local API endpoints, such as LM Studio.

## üéØ Project Vision

DoBA pushes AI towards:
- **Autonomous Decision Making** ‚Äî Self-aware AI capable of independent reasoning
- **Neuron-like Memory** ‚Äî Sophisticated, multi-layered memory similar to biological brains
- **Emotional Intelligence** ‚Äî Context-aware emotional analysis and pattern recognition
- **Precision Processing** ‚Äî High-accuracy responses with confidence scoring and memory-backed facts

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Nuclear Memory:** Core fact storage, tokenized fact extraction, and retrieval using SQLite
- **Tokenized Fact Extraction:** Extracts and stores granular facts for context-aware responses
- **Intelligent & Emotional Memory:** Semantic embeddings and emotional context storage
- **OCR and Document Analysis:** AI-powered extraction and analysis of text from documents and images
- **Semantic Search:** Advanced similarity matching with sentence transformers
- **LM Studio Integration:** Local LLM inference via [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)
- **GPU Acceleration:** Support for NVIDIA CUDA and AMD ROCm, plus CPU-only mode
- **Extensible Plugins:** Architecture for custom AI and processing plugins
- **Multi-threaded Processing:** Enhanced performance and parallelism
- **User-friendly GUI:** Tkinter interface for direct interaction

## üõ† Installation

**Prerequisites**
- Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended)
- Python 3.8+
- Optional: NVIDIA/AMD GPU (CPU-only supported)
- LM Studio running locally on `http://localhost:1234`

**Quick Setup**
```sh
chmod +x setup.sh
sudo ./setup.sh
```
- Detects OS and GPU (NVIDIA/AMD/CPU)
- Installs all dependencies and Python packages
- Sets up DoBA with optimized launcher scripts

**Manual Setup**
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Chrismmaldonado/DoBA.git
    cd DoBA
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Initialize databases:
    ```sh
    python reset_databases.py
    ```
4. Start LM Studio locally on port 1234
5. Run DoBA:
    ```sh
    ./launch_doba.sh
    ```
    or
    ```sh
    ./launch_gpu.sh
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

- Launch DoBA via the provided launcher script or `python DobAEI.py`
- Ensure LM Studio is running on `localhost:1234`
- Interact with DoBA through the GUI; memory and facts are automatically extracted, tokenized, and stored

**Memory Management**
```python
# Reset all databases (creates backups automatically)
python reset_databases.py
```
- Stores conversation history, extracted/tokenized facts, emotional context, and semantic embeddings

**Configuration**
- `LMSTUDIO_API`: Change LM Studio endpoint if not using default
- `DB_CONFIG`: Customize database storage and backup options

## üèó Architecture

- **Nuclear Memory:** Fast, reliable fact storage and tokenized retrieval with SQLite backend
- **Memory Layers:** Nuclear, intelligent (embeddings), and emotional/contextual memory
- **Semantic Processing:** Sentence transformer‚Äìbased search and similarity
- **Self-Awareness:** Modules for monitoring and autonomous behavior
- **Emotional Analyzer:** Contextual emotion detection and pattern storage

**Example Database Schema**
```sql
CREATE TABLE nuclear_facts (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    category TEXT NOT NULL,
    key TEXT NOT NULL,
    value TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(category, key) ON CONFLICT REPLACE
);

CREATE TABLE memory_interactions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_message TEXT NOT NULL,
    ai_response TEXT,
    session_id TEXT,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## üîß API Integration

- Works natively with LM Studio (`http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions`)
- Edit launcher scripts or `DobAEI.py` to use custom endpoints
- No Docker required; lightweight with Python virtual environments
