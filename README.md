# DoBA
DoBA (Designed only By AI) is an open source project aiming to project AI development towards more autonomous, percise, neuron-like memory. This code is ran through an API (you can run whatever you want, but this code uses LM Studio). This code is open-source, and aims for any and all contributions to be documented on this repository.

This code in Python has integrated the following:

1.) Past and current conversational fact, recollection, analytical, and methodical approach to storing conversations.
2.) Excels beyond any current ChatGPT, Copilot, or any other AI memory system.
3.) AI is able to act autonomously rather than keywords, which a large amount of LLM's struggle with.
4.) This AI can detect emotions based off keywords in a conversation. This is the only type of "keyword" logic implemented into the ENTIRE code.
5.) DoBA is designed SOLEY using AI code. My personal code has NOT been implemented. Making this, truly, designed by AI.


This AI has be ability to become potentially "self-aware" in a sense where it can learn from it mistakes, correct them, and esentially recieve "infinite" data.

This is a MAJOR limiation that has impacted various well known LLM's.

This project is actively being worked on for AGI research purposes.
